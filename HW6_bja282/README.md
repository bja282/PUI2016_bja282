# HW 4

## Assignment 1
For Assignment 1, I worked with Enrique, Sofiya and Sebastian. I followed and completed Professor Bianco's skeleton notebook to the best of my ability. For fitting the line to the regression plot, I used an article published (and referenced in my Notebook) by Wired Magazine online. 

## Assignment 2
Working with Sebastian and Sofiya, I conducted a z-test on my Citibike analysis from Homework 3. I then re-uploaded that file with the results of that test. Sebastian, Sofiya, Jonathan and I completed our write up together on Authorea, working in a collaborative process to put together a description of our work and results. Our authorea write up is available here: https://www.authorea.com/users/106032/articles/134117/.
