# HW 10

## Assignment 1
For Assignment 1, I finished the lab notebook from class, tweaking and making additions where necessary. In particualr, I focused on making sure that all charts had proper explanations and labels. I also changed how the MonthlyAve column was being calculated, from .sum() to .mean(), which seemed more appropriate given that it was supposed to be an average across months, as opposed to a count of rides. In discussion with Jonathan and Scott, we agreed that this also seemed to eliminate potential bias resulting from the age of the stations, as some of the stations were most certainly new during the timeframe being studied. 

## Assignment 2
I worked with Scott, Jonathan, Bailey and Tyler on this assignment. The bulk of my efforts were spent on separating the rides for each of the seasons, and then setting up visual comparisons side by side to observe and analyze differences in ridership between the seasons.
