# HW 8

## Assignment 1
For Assignment 1, I continued working through the lab started during Julia Lane's lecture. I worked with Sebastian, Scott, Jonathan, Sofiya, Marc, and Bailey on the assignment. The assignment proved challenging in that the three datasets required to complete it each required wrangling and cleaning, and then additional work in order to eventually merge them together. Each of the data sources included extraneous information that needed to be either dropped or combined with other data in order to be assessed. Ultimately, I was able to wrangle all the data and mostly complete the assignment. I encountered some difficulties in ultimately grouping the final dataset by community board, which I was unable to overcome by the final deadline.
