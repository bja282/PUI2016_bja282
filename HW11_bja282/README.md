# HW 11

For these assignments I worked with Sebastian, Sofiya, Jonathan, Scott, Tyler, Bailey, and Fernando. 

## Assignment 1
For Assignment 1, I successfully filtered the dataframe to just Brooklyn, but initially struggled with getting CUSP's point to plot on the map. I was able to successfully achieve this with the help of groupmates Scott and Sofiya. 

## Assignment 2
I spent time wih Tyler, Sofiya, Bailey and Scott cleaning the data, which took a significant amount of time. Following that, I worked with Sebastian, Sofiya and Jonathan on finishing the clustering and mapping the values. After initially choosing 5 clusters, I retrofitted the number to 2, which appeared to be the number of clusters on the dendrogram to see if there was any correlation between the two. It appeared as though there was, but I need to explore whether it was poor practice to diminish the clusters after the fact on the kmeans to match the apparent calculations yielded by the dendrogram. I used the following tutorial to plot the kmeans clusters and their centroids as a scatter plot: https://www.codementor.io/python/tutorial/data-science-python-pandas-r-dimensionality-reduction.
