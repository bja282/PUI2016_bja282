# HW 7

For this assignment, I reviewed two classmates' plots: 

Lopa Maisha Ahsan, mal824, mal824
and
CHEN HONGTING, hc1924, overwaterland

I conducted my reviews according to our review of effective data visualization in class, as well as what in my opinion would have made their visuals clearer and more compelling. In general, I thought that they both successfully visualized the data they presented. 

After completing my review, I forked both repositories and then submitted my review. Both accepted my request.
