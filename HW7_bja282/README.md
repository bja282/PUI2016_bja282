# HW 7

For this assignment, I reviewed two classmates' plots: 

Lopa Maisha Ahsan, mal824, mal824
and
CHEN HONGTING, hc1924, overwaterland

I conducted my reviews according to our review of effective data visualization in class, as well as my general wishes for what might have made their graphs clearer and more compelling, in my opinion. In general, I thought that they both successfully visualized the data they presented. 

I forked both of their repositories and then submitted my review to them. Both accepted by request.
