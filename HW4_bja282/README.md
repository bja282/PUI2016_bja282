# HW 4

## Assignment 1: Review of Xu Chunqing's Citibike data

## Assignment 2: Literature Choices of Statistical Tests
I worked on this assignment with Jonathan Geis. He chose the logistic regression for 
differences between groups, and I chose a chi-square analysis. The research paper for the latter
is *True versus False Parasite Interactions: A Robust Method to Take Risk Factors into Account and Its Application to Feline Viruses* by 
    
    Eléonore Hellard,
    Dominique Pontier,
    Frank Sauvage,
    Hervé Poulet,
    David Fouchet, and can be found at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029618
