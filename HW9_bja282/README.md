# HW 9

For this assignment, I worked with Scott, Jonathan, Sofiya, Marc, Tyler and Bailey. Though I was ultimately unable to finish the assignment, I completed task 1 and was able to idetify that an event had indeed occurred and caused a massive drop in MTA swipes of all fare type. After calculating the date of the event, it became clear that Hurricane Sandy was the event responsible; the MTA closed the subways in anticipation in the storm, causing the drop.
